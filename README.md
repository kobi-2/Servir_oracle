# Servir
# A Restaurant Management System
This is Servir, a restaurant management system written in Java and databasing with Oracle.


## Useful Notes:
**
run the database.sql file in the local sql plus command prompt, as a system user.

check if the oracle instance is xe. if not, then would have to change connection parameter where it says xe.

**
do not clean and build. that somehow removes the ojdbc8.jar file
